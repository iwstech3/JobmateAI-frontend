## 🔄 Why Separate Backend and Frontend?

### Backend Repository (`JobmateAI-Backend/`)
Contains:
- Backend deployment guides
- Backend GitHub Actions workflow
- Backend-specific instructions

### Frontend Repository (`JobmateAI-Frontend/`)
Contains:
- Frontend deployment guides
- Frontend GitHub Actions workflow
- Frontend-specific instructions

### Why Separate?
- **Clear ownership**: Each team knows where their docs are
- **No confusion**: Frontend docs don't mix with backend docs
- **Independent**: Can update one without affecting the other
- **Scalable**: Easy to add more repos later
